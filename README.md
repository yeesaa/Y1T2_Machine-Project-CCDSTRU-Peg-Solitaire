# Y1T2_Machine-Project-CCDSTRU-Peg-Solitaire


# The game works like tic-tac-toe mixed w/ sudoku, with the game board like this:
#
#  [ ] [ ] [ ]
#  [ ] [ ] [ ]
#  [ ] [ ] [ ]
#
# Like tic-tac-toe, the winner is determined when three pieces sideby side are formed, and
# like sudoku, there are 9 numbers for each of the nine spaces. There are 2 rules:
#
# 1. Potential winning states cannot be thru diagonals
# 2. When three pieces side by side forms a sum LESS THAN 15, the last player who forms this state loses.
# 3. When three pieces form a sum of EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN 15 the game goes on.
# 4. Assuming the ENTIRE board is filled with all 9 numbers, with each row and column forming a sum of 15, then the player who moves last wins.
